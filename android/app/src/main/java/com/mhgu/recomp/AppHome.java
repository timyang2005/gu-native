/**
 * The app's own folder: settings, log, caches, game_folder.txt and the saves (MHGURecomp/). It is the external files
 * folder, Android/data/com.mhgu.recomp/files, unless the app can't write there.
 *
 * On Android 11 and later a file or folder made in Android/data by another app (a file manager working through
 * Shizuku, or adb) keeps that app as its owner, and nothing in this app can write it again (gu-native #176: "open
 * failed: EACCES" saving game_folder.txt). ensure(), at every start before anything is written:
 *  - gives back to the app what it can: a file it can't write, in a folder it can, is copied and put in its place
 *    (now the app's); a folder it can't write is renamed aside (<name>.other-app-<date>) and made again with copies;
 *  - if the folder itself can't be written (EACCES / EPERM, never a full or read-only storage, never a missing mount),
 *    moves to the private folder (files/ of the app's internal storage) for good: home.txt there says so, readable
 *    files of the old folder are copied (copied, never moved), and the player is told once (movedNotice).
 * runtime/main.c reads home.txt too, so the game and these screens always use the same folder.
